CLIENT / SERVER
-----------------
1) FullStack Flow:
   client and server are disconected
   Client (Native Android/WINFORM/React/Angular) ----> NODEJS/ASP.NET API
 - Client can be in any Platform technology
 - Usually server return JSON Data only
 - Client can get/send Json data
 - Client is responsible for creating its UI methodology based on the json data
 - SPA: Client is Single Page App
 - Client Server will comunicate using REST API:
   (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PETCH)
 - Browser client can use async java call: 
    FETCH / AXIOS / XHR
Flow Steps:
1) Client Request json data from server 
2) Server return Json Data
3) Client Get the JSON data and render ui dynamically on client CPU (Browser)

2) Monolitic Flow:
   server render html dynamically 
 - ASP.NET MVC / WEBFORMS / WEBPAGES
 - Server Send all HTML+JS+Css Dynamically and return it to client
 - PHP/MVC/NODEJS MVC
 - LESS JS
 - RETURN HTML + Data ready use by browser
 - good when no spa used
Flow steps:
1) client Request url from server 
2) Server will get client parameters and render HTML on server CPU dynamically
3) html with data send to client
4) client display full html as is from the server
